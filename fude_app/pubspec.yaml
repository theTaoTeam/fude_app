flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/larry.jpg
   - assets/tempfudeicon.png
   - assets/logo.png
   - assets/IconLight.png
   - assets/IconDark.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Muli
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Muli-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-BlackItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-BoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-ExtraLightItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-Italic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-LightItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Muli-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
